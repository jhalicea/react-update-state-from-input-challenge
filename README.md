# Challenge: Update Data from Form Input
In this React challenge, we'll update data using an input field.

## The main tasks are:
- Use an input field to accept text
- Update your UI based on that input field
- Use React state to automatically update your UI
- Update data using a form

If you get stuck [watch this video](https://scotch.io/courses/10-react-challenges-beginner/use-react-state-to-update-the-dom)  but don't use hooks. Use a simple State and setState method.

If after watching the video you are still stuck look at answer.js inside public folder
